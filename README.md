# SIC-XE-Assembler

SIC-XE-Assembler made in C++ supporting Program Blocks for CSN-252 course at IIT Roorkee by Gyanendra Kumar Banjare (21114040).

## How to run

### On Linux:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xn4utilus/SIC-XE-Assembler.git
cd SIC-XE-Assembler
make
cd build
./assembler
```

Now enter the name of the input file for example `input0.txt` and find the generated output files in the same folder.  

## Code

The source code can be found at `src` folder. `src/utils.cpp` contains frequently used utlity functions like `intToStringHex()`, `stringHexToInt()` etc.

`src/table_structs.cpp` contains:

```
SYMTAB:
The struct contains information of labels like name, address, block number, a character 
representing whether the label exits in the symbol table or not, an integer representing 
whether label is relative or not.
OPTAB:
The struct contains information of opcode like name, format, a character representing 
whether the opcode is valid or not.
LITTAB:
The struct contains information of literals like its value, address, block number, a character 
representing whether the literal exits in the literal table or not.
REGTAB:
The struct contains information of registers like its numeric equivalent, a character 
representing whether the registers exits or not.
BLOCKS:
The struct contains information of blocks like its name, start address, block number, location 
counter value for end address of block, a character representing whether the block exits or 
not
```

`src/pass1.cpp` generates Symbol Table, Intermediate File for the pass2 and also generates error file.

`src/pass2.cpp` works on the Intermediate File generated by pass1 and generates Listing File and Object Program File

## Sample programs

Sample programs can be found at `sample` and they are also copied to `build` after running `make` command.
